### A fun and easy way of programming for hobby purposes
This programming language aims to be a very easy to understand way of programming for non programmers and people who want to experiment with writing working code in a few minutes. The goal of this project is to make a console-based compiler which can be easily set up with the manual, and with the help of a video.

> This programming language might seem pointless to some, but It's very easy to learn, and thanks to it's procedural structure, it's easy to read and set up small programs for hobby or research reasons.

#### What can it do?
Note: this programming language compiler is still in development, it's currently a pre release version, so the following functionnalities only will be available from the release v1.0

- Input from console
- Print to console
- Detect keypresses
- Open files
- Write into files
- Mathematical operations
- Access some system properties of your machine
- Bind ports
- Use sound output
---
- In later development a graphical module will be available for graphical applications
- In later development a microcontroller compiler will be available for hobby projects

### What can I use it for?
    It might give you an idea how to start programming, how to set up algorythms and how to command the computer to execute a specific task
